Traverses a directory structure containing TV Shows in the format:
```
basepath/

|    |--- Season 01/
|    |    |--- 01 - Pilot.avi
|    |    |--- 02 - The Second.avi
|    |--- Season 02

...
```
and adds the TV Show and season information to the respective media files like this:
```
basepath/
|--- ALF/
|    |--- Season 01/
|    |    |--- ALF.01x01 - Pilot.avi
|    |    |--- ALF.01x02 - The Second.avi
